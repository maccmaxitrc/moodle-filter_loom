# Loom Embed

Loom Embed is a Moodle filter that transforms Loom share links into embedded videos.

Works well in tandem with the [Loom Button plugin](https://github.com/maccmaxitrc/moodle-atto_loom).

# Installation

1. Download the plugin and extract into *filter/loom*.
2. Install like any other Moodle plugin (visit Site Administration).
3. Turn on the filter at the site level:

   *Site Administration -> Filters -> Manage Filters*

4. Turn on the filter at the course level: 
   
   *Course Settings -> Filters*

# Usage

Here are a few examples of links that will be transformed into embedded videos:

* loom.com/share/abc123
* h<span></span>ttps://loom.com/share/abc123
* h<span>ttps://ww</span>w.loom.com/share/abc123
* loom.com/embed/abc123
